## General Information
Gamelab I is a university course at Uni WÃ¼rzburg, in which we were tasked to create our own game from scratch over the length of two semesters.

My game is a one versus one online game, where the player's goal is to knock their enemy off the stage with various objects scattered around the map.

The motivation for me to create such a game was due to the situation we were in throughout the years 2020 and 2021: I felt like people needed a way to connect during those times and the simpler it could be managed the better.

This game was just intended to be a fun game you play with friends for maybe an hour after work to cool off.
With this in mind and very little game development knowledge prior to this project, I decided to keep it as simple and stupid as possible.

At the end of the summer semester we were tasked to present our project at a big expo in our university. For that event 
we also needed to create a poster and a trailer to promote our game. In addition a report explaining the project to our professors had to be written. These deliverables are inserted in the "presentation" folder.
