## General Informations
Gamelab I is a university course in WÃ¼rzburg, in which we were tasked to create our own game from scratch over the length of two semesters.

My game is a one versus one online game, where your goal is to knock your enemy off the stage with various object scattered around the map.

The motivation for me to create a game like this was due to the situation we were in throughout the year 2020 - 2021.
I felt like people need a way to connect during those times and the simpler it can be the better.

This game was just intended to be a fun game you play with friends for maybe an hour after work to cool off.
With this in mind and very few game development knowledge prior to this project I decided to keep it simple
and not overcomplicate every little detail.

At the end of the summer semester we are tasked to present our project at an big expo in our uni, for that event 
we also need to create a poster and trailer to promote our game. On top of that a report has to be written
explaining the project to our professors. Those deliverables can be seen in the "presentation" folder.
